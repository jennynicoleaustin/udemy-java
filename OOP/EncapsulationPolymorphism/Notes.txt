Encapsulation

-- public variables within a class = access outside the class.
You can see the inner workings of the variables defined publicly.
-- allows control outside the class and opens up the application to be altered in ways we do not want.

The right way to create a class is to use encapsulation

declare variables within the class as private.
-- then the only way to get the values is to use the public getter.
-- getters are the way we get the information
include basic validation within the constructor.

-- change the names within the class without effecting the code outside the class

-- protect members ot variables
