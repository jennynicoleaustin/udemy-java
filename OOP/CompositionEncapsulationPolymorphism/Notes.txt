Inheritance vs Composition

-- Inheritance: the subclass IS A superclass.
is a camry IS A car

Composition
-- superclass HAS A subclass
ie a Monitor HAS A resolution - composition

can define that a class HAS multiple classes (vs inheritance where you can only inherit one class at a time)

objects within objects
