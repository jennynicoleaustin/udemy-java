// Object-Oriented Programming
    // Objects = state & behavior
// Software objects: state is stored in variables while methods are the behavior.
    // class = template or blueprint for creating objects
        // allows you to create a data type that is "beefed up" when compared to primitive data types

//Class naming conventions - first letter of the class name should be uppercase
    //Create a class = public class NameOfClass

//public keyword refers to the access rights of the class, public being unrestricted access to the class
// private = no other class can access that class.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
