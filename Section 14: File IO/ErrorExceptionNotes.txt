:::::Exceptions::::::

Try & Catch & If/Else
- both can check for an error and gives a code block to execute in case the first code block fails
try/catch for exceptions


::: Stack Trace & Call Stack :::

Usually when catching an exception, you would specify the subclass of exceptions you want to catch

Java handles exceptions by printing a stack trace
- a print out of all the method calls at the point where the program crashed
:How to make sense of the stack trace
-- Start at the bottom and work your way up

When including a try catch the return should be places within the try block. Returns under the catch are unreachable.
::Multiple catch

--- you can have more than one catch for a single try; allows you to catch multiple types of exceptions and throw errors for each one.

Catch multiple exceptions via the main method
- place the method call within a try catch with the catch to include all exceptions with | separating each one
( | = a byte wise or operator)
